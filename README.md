# ðŸ”Ž Automated Piston Inspection with Collaborative Robotics and Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Piston Inspection Project** is an automated quality control solution that integrates:
- **Collaborative robotics (Cobot)**
- **High-quality imaging**
- **YOLOv8-based defect detection**  

It replaces slow, error-prone manual inspections with a **fast, repeatable, and scalable** automated pipeline.  
**Inspection time reduced** to **33 seconds per piston** in prototype trials.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Automatic multi-view imaging** with precise Cobot positioning and rotation
- **Basler ace** high-resolution camera with optimized lighting, polarizer, and diffuser
- **Industry-aligned dataset** with load zones, defect types, and acceptance limits
- **YOLOv8** retrained for subtle piston defect detection
- **ROS + TM ROS Driver** integration for cobot control
- Results stored in a structured **database** for traceability

## ðŸ›  System Workflow
1. **Piston Handling:**  
   Cobot grips and rotates the piston to capture views from **multiple angles**.

2. **Imaging:**  
   Basler ace camera + controlled lighting capture high-contrast images.

3. **Preprocessing:**  
   Convert to **grayscale** for enhanced defect visibility.

4. **ML Inference:**  
   YOLOv8 model detects and classifies defects based on load zones & acceptance limits.

5. **Results Logging:**  
   Store annotated images and classification results in the database.

  - **Red:** High-stress areas (strictest inspection)  
  - **Yellow:** Medium stress  
  - **Green:** Low stress
- **Defect Types:** Annotated for classification
- **Acceptance Limits:** Defined per defect type for pass/fail decisions
